# raspberry_pi_image_shrink
Script to shrink Raspberry Pi images


I took this script from Adafruit at the following link:
https://learn.adafruit.com/resizing-raspberry-pi-boot-partition/bonus-shrinking-images

I modified it so it uses the next available /dev/loop number instead of being hardcoded to 2. If the original author or Adafruit wants me to remove this repo, please email me and I'll happily remove it. I am not trying to take credit for this script, I just figured this small change might be useful to others.
